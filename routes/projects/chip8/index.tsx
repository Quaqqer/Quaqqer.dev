Select a ROM and start playing! My personal favorite is Tetris. :)

CHIP-8 uses a 4x4 pad for controls, the tables below show how keys are mapped on
the keyboard. Since every game has different controls, you will have to discover
them for yourself.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>

      <td>C</td>

### Description

This is a basic CHIP-8 emulator implemented in JavaScript (or TypeScript
rather). I followed a [high-level guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/)
which was a good middle-ground between challenging and fun.
